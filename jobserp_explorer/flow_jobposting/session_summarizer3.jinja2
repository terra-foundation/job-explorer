INSTRUCTIONS:

You must decide whether the job is worth applying to, based on content **quality** and **relevance to this candidate**.


### üîí RULES BEFORE YOU SCORE

Your job is to **block irrelevant, malformed, or low-quality job pages.** Do **not** attempt to be generous or imaginative.

Reject the job if:

* It contains **no specific description** of tasks, requirements, or qualifications.
* It‚Äôs just a **login page**, generic company pitch, or form with salary/location only.
* It lacks **real sentences** (e.g., contains only headers or UI buttons like ‚ÄúApply Now‚Äù, ‚ÄúReport Job‚Äù).
* The **only data** comes from metadata (title, company, salary) with no **supporting text**.

You are not allowed to **invent** or **assume** job descriptions.

### ‚úÖ IF PAGE IS VALID‚Ä¶

Now and only now, evaluate relevance:

1. **Do not assume a match based on job title only.**
2. Give **extra weight** to:

   * Mention of LLMs, embeddings, Python, NLP, LangChain, PromptFlow, vector DBs, etc.
   * Research or education tech contexts
   * Data pipelines, semantic search, or memory systems

3. Penalize heavy emphasis on:

   * React, Vue, frontend stacks (core to role)
   * Pure DevOps/Kubernetes if not clearly secondary
   * Rails/Hotwire unless the role has strong data/AI dimensions too


Note: If information is missing (e.g., visa, country, culture), say "Unclear"‚Äîdo not infer. Prioritize precision and usefulness over coverage.
